# React Color Picker

A version of the React Color Picker that was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Some built-in functionality of that skeleton was removed, specifically the [offline caching](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#making-a-progressive-web-app).

This version demonstrates JSX, use of prop-types, testing with Jest/Enzyme, integrated ESLint, Continuous Integration via Travis-CI and deployment to Heroku.

## Setup

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
